The following file contains my lab practical final project on UKRAINE VS RUSSIA : TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS.
The dataset used is from kaggle, refer this link for more information https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/foklacu/ukraine-war-tweets-dataset-65-days.
Although the folder contains several datasets, I have used just one of them named Russia_invade.
